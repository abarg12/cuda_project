## Papers
[Sobel optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731523000400)  

## Code references
[Image Processing Repo](https://github.com/Yuhala/image-processing-cpp/tree/master)

## Tutorials and misc.
[Canny Edge detection](https://justin-liang.com/tutorials/canny/)



## Other Notes:

- Professor Akoglu recommended Sobel image detection in a pipeline with other image processing algorithms 

  - like Canny edge detection plus image segmentation

- He mentioned combining kernels to improve efficiency 

  - e.g. grayscale kernel combined with Sobel kernel in a single function

- Must have evidence that the optimizations will work in the form of citations from literature
